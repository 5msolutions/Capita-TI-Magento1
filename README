Overview
--------

The purpose of Capita_TI is to export entity text data to a remote server -
https://api.capitatranslationinterpreting.com/ - and wait for translations.
Each 'request' is polled until it's status changes and there are new documents
to download. These must then be imported to the same entities from whence they
came (products, categories, etc.).

The list of languages retrieved from the API might be user-specific (oneday)
and are cached with a short time. Almost every related page uses this list
so the API credentials get regularly tested, expired accounts will get
noticed pretty quickly.

XLIFF format (http://docs.oasis-open.org/xliff/v1.2/os/xliff-core.html) was
chosen for ex/imports. It supports marking non-translateable parts within text,
which is perfect for those awkward HTML tags. An explanation and directions for
encoding HTML can be found here:
http://docs.oasis-open.org/xliff/v1.2/xliff-profile-html/xliff-profile-html-1.2-cd02.html

Like any considerate design this can have wider applications.
XLIFF is an open standard and another translator service need only change the
descendents of Zend_Http_Client in "code/Model/Api/".

Changes to the global (internationalised) data are tracked in "diff" tables.
An entity is then considered translated if it has (localised) data in store views
and no tracked changes.
Not all fields need to be translated, there may be good reasons why some are not.
We cannot guarantee that all translation work was done through this module so
we must assume that any localised data is good. 


Test Driven Development
-----------------------

Unit testing is performed with https://github.com/EcomDev/EcomDev_PHPUnit/
EComDev is somewhat outdated and relies on PHP~5 and PhpUnit~4.
To test it is recommended to first install a copy of Magento~1.7 then use
Composer to supply the other requirements, remember to specify versions:

$ composer require phpunit/phpunit:~4

EComDev_PhpUnit itself will need a blank database,
follow the instructions from the above link.


Installation
------------

Optimised for https://github.com/colinmollenhour/modman
The usual Magento procedure then follows, make sure caches are cleared
then visit any page and the auto-update scripts will trigger.


Distribution
------------

I've been using https://github.com/clockworkgeek/MagentoTagToConnect
to generate uploadable packages but that is not required.
The old way (System > Magento Connect > Package Extensions) still works.
The finished package then goes to the Connect Manager on a site or the
Connect market instead.
